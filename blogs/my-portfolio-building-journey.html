                <p>I will be talking about my journey, utilizing CSS, HTML, and Javascript to design my first personal website.</p>
                
                <h2>First Steps</h2>
                <p>My prior website design experience had only consisted of template design using WordPress to create a website for Santa Clara University (refer to my portfolio for more information). However, I had no prior experience utilizing HTML, CSS, or Javascript to design a website from scratch.

                <h2>Learning the Basics</h2>
                <p>I started by learning HTML to design the basic framework of the website, and then moved on to CSS for styling the website. The most challenging part for me was understanding how to make the website interactive and aesthetically pleasing for the end user.</p>
                
                <h2>Adding Interactivity</h2>
                <p>Once I had the basic structure and styling down, I started to learn how to use JavaScript to add interactive elements. Through the Hack4Impact bootcamp, I learned about DOM manipulation and how it could help my website come to life through a more interactive system.</p>
                         
                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>Beyond the experience I gained with utilizing tools such as CSS, HTML, and Javascript, I also learned some more practical skills I could utilize in the future such as being able to design a product from scratch with a tool I had no prior experience with. While there were times where I found parts of the process tedious, I learned to problem solve by doing research and adapting upon the resources I was given to build this website.</p>
