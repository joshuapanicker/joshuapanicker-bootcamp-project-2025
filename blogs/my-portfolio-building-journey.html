                <p>I will be talking about my journey, utilizing CSS, HTML, and Javascript to design my first personal website.</p>
                
                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>When I first decided to create my personal website, I had no idea where to begin. I knew I wanted to showcase my projects and skills, but the technical aspects seemed overwhelming at first.</p>
                
                <h2>Learning the Basics</h2>
                <p>I started by learning HTML to structure my content, then moved on to CSS for styling. The most challenging part was understanding how to make the website responsive and look good on different devices.</p>
                
                <h2>Adding Interactivity</h2>
                <p>Once I had the basic structure and styling down, I began learning JavaScript to add interactive elements. This is where I discovered the power of DOM manipulation and how it can bring a static website to life.</p>
                
                <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges was understanding how different browsers interpret CSS and JavaScript. I spent countless hours debugging layout issues and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.</p>
                
                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>This project taught me the importance of planning before coding, the value of testing across different devices, and how rewarding it can be to see your ideas come to life on the web.</p>
