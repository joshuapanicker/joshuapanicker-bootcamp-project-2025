                <p>I will discuss my computer science journey from the beginning, explaining what brought me here and why I continue to pursue this interest.</p>
                
                <h2>The Catalyst of my Journey</h2>
                <p>My passion for Computer Science began in eighth grade when I built my very own personal computer using spare parts from my dad's shed for the purpose of playing video games. Realizing this interest which I had for hardware as well as video gaming, my dad introduced me to the programming language of python. Together, we designed a simple asteroid collision video game where a user would control a character through arrow movements to avoid randomly generated asteroids. Since then, I had gained a newfound passion for the realm of software development.</p>
                
                <h2>An Obstacle that Turned into an Opportunity</h2>
                <p>To build upon this interest which I had built in the field, in the summer of my sophomore year of high school, I had enrolled for concurrent enrollment in both AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles. Unfortunately, due to my school's lottery system, I was denied my request to both classes. Thus, I took the initiative to join a dual enrollment course on the Fundamentals of Java Programming at my local community college. Although my workload had nearly doubled as a high school student by taking this course, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience which I gained through practicing and learning the fundamentals of Java programming. This experience led me to pursue various other dual enrollment courses throughout high school, such as C++ and Python coding classes, an Intermediate Java programming course, Discrete Mathematics, and an Operating Systems Course.</p>
                
                <h2>A Roadblock that Altered my Perspective</h2>
                <p>One of the classes which I struggled with the most was my Intermediate Java Programming class. With various complex assignments, I would constantly face compilation errors that would take me hours to solve. During the assessments with our timing being limited, I would find myself crumbling under the pressure to make sure my code compiled and would run out of time to verify the validity of my code. Thus, because of how behind I felt, I decided to attend my professor's office hours to fundamentally understand the source of the problem with how I was grasping content in class. I realized that I needed to dedicate so much more time to the class to keep up with the rest of my classmates. Over time, I was able to hone my study skills and build upon virtues of patience and resilience, both of which would help me through pursuit of a computer science degree in college. </p>
                                
                <h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
                <p>Now, as a college freshman pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I want to expand upon what I have learned through new skills and fundamental knowledge I can gain from my both my Data Structures coursework as well as the clubs I am joining such as Hack4Impact and Codebox. I hope that through these skills which I build, I can soon be industry ready and able to contribute to meaningful projects.</p>
